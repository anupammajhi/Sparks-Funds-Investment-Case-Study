## Project Brief

You work for Spark Funds, an [asset management company](http://www.wallstreetmojo.com/what-is-asset-management-company-amc/). Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.



## Business and Data Understanding

Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

1. It wants to invest between **5 to 15 million USD** per round of investment
2. It wants to invest only in **English-speaking countries** because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

- For your analysis, consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
- You may use this list: Click [here](http://www.emmir.org/fileadmin/user_upload/admission/Countries_where_English_is_an_official_language.pdf) for a list of countries where English is an official language.

You have to use three main data tables for the entire analysis (**available for download on the next page**):
